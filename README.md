Hermes
======
**God of inter-frame communication**

Hermes is a library that manages the communication with your windows' child frames; both `<iframe>`s and `window.open()`s. 
It's meant to build paneled apps on, a bit like the Adobe Creative Suite works.

You can find documentation, guides, FAQs and much more in the [wiki](https://github.com/TuurDutoit/hermes/wiki).
